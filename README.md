# Data Analytics Showcase | Power BI Portfolio by Justin Cole

Welcome to my Power BI portfolio ‚Äî a demonstration of analytical storytelling, creative visual design, and technical problem-solving.

This repository contains two projects:

---

## Personal Performance & Growth Report

**Scope:**  
An interactive report that visualizes a five-year timeline of professional milestones, creative pursuits, and personal growth ‚Äî including marathon training, skill development, and certifications.

**Purpose:**  
Built to showcase my Power BI skills, this report draws from self-logged data across work, education, running, weather, creative activity, and certification prep. It integrates multiple data sources and demonstrates how to use Power BI not just for business KPIs, but for compelling narratives.

**Highlights:**
- **Custom DAX Measures** for calculating pace, miles, fastest time, activity time, and productivity by weekday
- **Data Modeling** across multiple tables (fact & dimension structure)
- **ETL Techniques** using Power Query for cleaning, shaping, and merging personal datasets
- **Interactive Design** with intuitive buttons and tooltips, allowing users to explore:
  - Experience Timeline (work, education, speeches, certifications)
  - Activity Dashboard (productivity and time management across weeks)
  - Marathon Dashboard (pace by run, mileage by training phase, elevation analysis)

**Tools Used:**
- Power BI Desktop
- DAX (custom columns, measures, KPIs)
- Power Query for data transformation

## Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Report

**Scope:**  
An analysis of symptom severity and treatment outcomes across 500 patients using four common Parkinson‚Äôs medications and three levels of physical activity.

While secondary to this portfolio, this report demonstrates my ability to work with real-world healthcare data ‚Äî highlighting statistical trends and communicating results to non-technical audiences.

**Key Insights:**
- Comparative analysis of medication effectiveness using UPDRS scores
- Impact of exercise levels on mobility, balance, and overall symptom control
